excerpt: "About Me..."
---
I am the Associate Director of Data Science at the [Critical Path Institute](https://c-path.org/), where we enhance the value of rare disease patient-level data through curation, standardization, integration across diverse data sources, and the development of drug development tools. My work focuses on leveraging my expertise in ontology development, data standards, and annotation to lead a team of data scientists in building and implementing a data curation pipeline using the organizationâ€™s knowledge graph.

In addition, I am the Owner and President of Rose City Data Science LLC, specializing in consulting on biomedical ontology development and curation. I contribute to the [Mondo Disease Ontology](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/), a semantic standard for disease classification and definitions. I am also involved in educational initiatives, promoting best practices in data management and data science, including through the [OBO Academy](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/).
